## Why Archived?

These files were archived to:
1. Reduce confusion for AI agents working on the project
2. Keep the npm package lean (exclude internal/historical docs)
3. Maintain historical record for reference
4. Prevent outdated information from being used

The current documentation in `/docs` is comprehensive, up-to-date, and optimized for AI agent consumption with machine-readable metadata.
